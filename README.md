# Vue3_.netAPI

Before running project, go to the vue-client folder and run "yarn install" to install the front end dependencies for the application. 

You will also have to run Update-Database from the package manager console or the equivalent dotnet ef database update from the command line when in the root of the same directory as the csproj file. 

After that you can open up a terminal and run "dotnet run" in the same directory as the csproj file, or simply run from visual studio, up to you. 

The csproj file has the configuration to run the vue app when it starts up.

Enjoy
