# Vue3_.netAPI

Before running project, go to the vue-client folder and run "yarn install" to install the front end dependencies for the application. 

After that you can open up a terminal and run "dotnet run" in the same directory as the csproj file, or simply run from visual studio, up to you. 

The csproj file has the configuration to run the vue app when it starts up.

Enjoy
